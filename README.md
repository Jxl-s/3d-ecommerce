# 3D eCommerce ðŸ›’

A small project, that will hopefully make use of 3D web technologies to display products in an eCommerce-style web application. Nothing is finished, this is progressively being worked on.

This is also a way for me to explore Next.JS 14, as its differences from Next.JS 13 are quite significant.

## Demo
- A demo can be found here: [VirtuMarket](https://virtu-market.vercel.app)

## Some Features
- Supports light/dark mode
- English/french languages (todo)

## Current working on
- Implementing the page design into code

## Will be worked on
- Anything related to logic
